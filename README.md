# No Directional Skills
**Note: By default, this disables ALL directional skills.**

**To re-enable directional casting, edit `config/config.js` to `false` for each skill.**

Removes directional input on some skills, so they always go toward camera target.

## Known Issues
* Only works if using default directional keys: `WASD`
* Holding down all 4 movement keys will make directional skills cast North. This is a client bug, not proxy.
